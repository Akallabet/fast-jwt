## Installation

Just run:

npm install fast-jwt
```

## Usage

### createSigner

Create a signer function by calling `createSigner` and providing one or more of the following options:

- `secret`: A string, buffer or object containing the secret for `HS*` algorithms or the PEM encoded public key for `RS*`, `PS*` and `ES*` algorithms (whose format is defined by the Node's crypto module documentation). The secret can also be a function accepting a Node style callback or a function returning a promise. This is the only mandatory option.
- `algorithm`: The algorithm to use to sign the token, default is `HS256`.
- `encoding`: The token encoding, default is `utf-8`.
- `cache`: Enable caching of signed tokens, which will dramatically improve performances (see benchmarks section below). This is only available if `noTimestamp` option is `true` and `mutatePayload`, `expiresIn` and `notBefore` options are either unset or `false`. Default is `false`.
- `mutatePayload`: If the original payload must be modified in place (via `Object.assign`) and thus will result changed to the caller funciton.
- `expiresIn`: Time span (in milliseconds) after which the token expires, added as the `exp` claim in the payload. This will override any existing value in the claim.
- `notBefore`: Time span (in milliseconds) before the token is active, added as the `nbf` claim in the payload. This will override any existing value in the claim.
- `jti`: The token id, added as the `jti` claim in the payload. This will override any existing value in the claim.
- `aud`: The token audience, added as the `aud` claim in the payload. It must be a string or an array of strings. This will override any existing value in the claim.
- `iss`: The token audience, added as the `iss` claim in the payload. It must be a string. This will override any existing value in the claim.
- `sub`: The token audience, added as the `sub` claim in the payload. It must be a string. This will override any existing value in the claim.
- `nonce`: The token audience, added as the `nonce` claim in the payload. It must be a string. This will override any existing value in the claim.
- `kid`: The token key id, added as the `kid` claim in the header section. It must be a string.
- `header`: Additional claims to add to the header section. This will override the `typ` and `kid` claims.
- `noTimestamp`: If the `iat` claimÂ should not be added to the token.
- `clockTimestamp`: The timestamp in milliseconds (like the output of `Date.now()`) that should be used as the current time for all necessary time comparisons. Default is the system time.

The signer is a function which accepts a payload and returns the token.

The payload must be a object, a buffer or a string. If not a object, all the options of the signer which modify the the payload will be ignored. If `iat` claim is already present, it won't be overwritten with the current timestamp.

If the `secret` option is a function, the signer will also accept a Node style callback and will return a promise, supporting therefore both callback and async/await styles.

#### Example

```javascript
const {createSigner} = require('fast-jwt')

// Sync style
const signSync = createSigner({ secret: 'secret' })
const token = signSync({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3})
// => eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhIjoxLCJiIjoyLCJjIjozLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzk1MjEyMTJ9.mIcxteEVjbh2MnKQ3EQlojZojGSyA_guqRBYHQURcfnCSSBTT2OShF8lo9_ogjAv-5oECgmCur_cDWB7x3X53g

// Callback style
const signWithCallback = createSigner({ secret: (callback) => callback(null, 'secret') })

signWithCallback({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}, (err, token) => {
  // token === eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhIjoxLCJiIjoyLCJjIjozLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzk1MjEyMTJ9.mIcxteEVjbh2MnKQ3EQlojZojGSyA_guqRBYHQURcfnCSSBTT2OShF8lo9_ogjAv-5oECgmCur_cDWB7x3X53g
})

// Promise style - Note that the secret function style and the signer function style are unrelated
async function test() {
  const signWithPromise = createSigner({ async secret(): => 'secret' })

  const token = await signWithPromise({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3})
  // => eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhIjoxLCJiIjoyLCJjIjozLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzk1MjEyMTJ9.mIcxteEVjbh2MnKQ3EQlojZojGSyA_guqRBYHQURcfnCSSBTT2OShF8lo9_ogjAv-5oECgmCur_cDWB7x3X53g
}
```

### createDecoder

Create a decoder function by calling `createDecoder` and providing one or more of the following options:

- `complete`: Return an object with the decoded header, payload, signature and input (the token part before the signature), instead of just the content of the payload. Default is `false`.
- `json`: Always parse the payload as JSON even if the `typ` claim of the header is not `JWT`. Default is `false`.
- `encoding`: The token encoding, default is `utf-8`.
- `cache`: Enable caching of decoded tokens, which will dramatically improve performances (see benchmarks section below). Default is `false`.

The decoder is a function which accepts a token (as Buffer or string) and returns the payload or the sections of the token.

#### Examples

```javascript
const { createDecoder } = require('fast-jwt')
const token =
  'eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhIjoxLCJiIjoyLCJjIjozLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzk1MjEyMTJ9.mIcxteEVjbh2MnKQ3EQlojZojGSyA_guqRBYHQURcfnCSSBTT2OShF8lo9_ogjAv-5oECgmCur_cDWB7x3X53g'

// Standard decoder
const decode = createDecoder()
const payload = decode(token)
// => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, iat: 1579521212 }

// Complete decoder
const decodeComplete = createDecoder({ complete: true })
const sections = decodeComplete(token)
/* => 
  { 
    header: { alg: 'HS512', typ: 'JWT' }, 
    payload: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, iat: 1579521212 },
    signature: 'mIcxteEVjbh2MnKQ3EQlojZojGSyA/guqRBYHQURcfnCSSBTT2OShF8lo9/ogjAv+5oECgmCur/cDWB7x3X53g==',
    input: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhIjoxLCJiIjoyLCJjIjozLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzk1MjEyMTJ9' 
  }
*/
```

### createVerifier

Create a verifier function by calling `createVerifier` and providing one or more of the following options:

- `secret`: A string, buffer or object containing the secret for `HS*` algorithms or the PEM encoded public key for `RS*`, `PS*` and `ES*` algorithms (whose format is defined by the Node's crypto module documentation). The secret can also be a function accepting a Node style callback or a function returning a promise. This is the only mandatory option, which must NOT be provided if the token algorithm is `none`.
- `algorithms`: List of strings with the names of the allowed algorithms. By default, all algorithms are accepted.
- `complete`: Return an object with the decoded header, payload, signature and input (the token part before the signature), instead of just the content of the payload. Default is `false`.
- `encoding`: The token encoding. Default is `utf-8`.
- `cache`: Enable caching of verified tokens, which will dramatically improve performances (see benchmarks section below). This will consider token time claims about expiration and validity. If the verifier is set to use asynchronous secret fetching and the response are time sensitive, this should probably be left disabled. Default is `false`.
- `allowedJti`: A string, a regular expression, an array of strings or an array of regular expressions containing allowed values for the id claim (`jti`). By default, all values are accepted.
- `allowedAud`: A string, a regular expression, an array of strings or an array of regular expressions containing allowed values for the audience claim (`aud`). By default, all values are accepted.
- `allowedIss`: A string, a regular expression, an array of strings or an array of regular expressions containing allowed values for the issuer claim (`iss`). By default, all values are accepted.
- `allowedSub`: A string, a regular expression, an array of strings or an array of regular expressions containing allowed values for the subject claim (`sub`). By default, all values are accepted.
- `allowedNonce`: A string, a regular expression, an array of strings or an array of regular expressions containing allowed values for the nonce claim (`nonce`). By default, all values are accepted.
- `ignoreExpiration`: Do not validate the expiration of the token. Default is `false`.
- `ignoreNotBefore`: Do not validate the activation of the token. Default is `false`.
- `maxAge`: The maximum allowed age (in milliseconds) for tokens to still be valid. By default this is not checked.
- `clockTimestamp`: The timestamp in milliseconds (like the output of `Date.now()`) that should be used as the current time for all necessary time comparisons. Default is the system time.
- `clockTolerance`: Timespan in milliseconds to add the current timestamp when performing time comparisons. Default is `0`.

The verifier is a function which accepts a token (as Buffer or string) and returns the payload or the sections of the token.

If the `secret` option is a function, the signer will also accept a Node style callback and will return a promise, supporting therefore both callback and async/await styles.

#### Examples

```javascript
const { createVerifier } = require('fast-jwt')
const token =
  'eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhIjoxLCJiIjoyLCJjIjozLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzk1MjEyMTJ9.mIcxteEVjbh2MnKQ3EQlojZojGSyA_guqRBYHQURcfnCSSBTT2OShF8lo9_ogjAv-5oECgmCur_cDWB7x3X53g'

// Sync style
const verifySync = createVerifier({ secret: 'secret' })
const payload = verifySync(token)
// => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, iat: 1579521212 }

// Callback style with complete return
const verifyWithCallback = createVerifier({ secret: callback => callback(null, 'secret'), complete: true })

verifyWithCallback(token, (err, sections) => {
  /*
  sections === {
    header: { alg: 'HS512', typ: 'JWT' },
    payload: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, iat: 1579521212 },
    signature: 'mIcxteEVjbh2MnKQ3EQlojZojGSyA/guqRBYHQURcfnCSSBTT2OShF8lo9/ogjAv+5oECgmCur/cDWB7x3X53g==',
    input: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhIjoxLCJiIjoyLCJjIjozLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzk1MjEyMTJ9'
  }
*/
})

// Promise style - Note that the secret function style and the verifier function style are unrelated
async function test() {
  const verifyWithPromise = createVerifier({ async secret(): => 'secret' })

  const payload = await verifyWithPromise(token)
  // => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, iat: 1579521212 }
}
```
